# Machine-Learning-in-Financial-Engineering-Homework-Project

Welcome to the FRE-GY 7773 Machine Learning in Financial Engineering course project repository. This repository contains all the assignments and projects completed during the Fall 2024 semester
---------------------------

## Course Overview
This course focuses on applying machine learning techniques, both classical (e.g., linear regression, Bayesian methods) and deep learning (e.g., neural networks), to make data-driven predictions. With an emphasis on experimentation and computational practice, it explores machine learning's broad applications beyond finance.
